# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Heart Disease are the ones that deals with blood vessels diseases, coronary artery diseases, and heart defects with which some people are born. “Heart Disease” is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that lead to blocking of blood vessels that leads to  heart attacks or stroke. According to the Centers of Disease Control(CDC) heart disease is one of the prominent reasons for deaths in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The prediction of heart disease is regarded as one of the most important in the clinical data analysis as we have a huge amount of healthcare data and the deaths due to heart diseases are the highest. Here in this paper we are using machine learning techniques in identifying the significant factors affecting the heart but building multiple models using machine learning algorithms and predicting the accuracy of the model and suggesting an conclusion to each model and predicting an better performing model which comes out to be three models namely SVM, XGBoost, KNN Classifications having 85.25% accuracy
